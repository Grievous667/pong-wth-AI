# pong-wth-AI
Classic pong with a few twists. Made in Pygame.

This mess of code is something I created for Python practice. To play, dowload to a unique folder and run via python. Currently, the program saves your settings via a txt file that will be generated in the same folder ("game_rules.txt").
